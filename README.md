# Wholesome notes

A note taking app that tells you a joke if you're having a bad day.

Allows you to keep track of notes and assign a sentiment to them. When you write a note with a negative sentiment, it displays a joke from https://github.com/sameerkumar18/geek-joke-api.

Uses Supabase for user management and for storing notes. Row Level Security is added to prevent one user from accessing the notes of someone else.
